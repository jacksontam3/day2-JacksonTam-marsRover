We also have a chance to develop a mars revor accoding to user needs.

Relection: Enjoy

Interpretive: Have a breify understanding about the TDD concept and how to use junit techniques

Decisional: I will try to adopt TDD development in my future work, like build test case first instead of just go direct in development
